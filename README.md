[Infi - Onze puzzel is onmogelijk te kraken. Behalve voor echte nerds](https://aoc.infi.nl/).

This project holds my solution to the above puzzle, coded in R.

I've chosen R as it's the language I most often use it at work, which allowed me to solve this puzzle in less than an hour. No Googling for correct syntax, function definitions, types, etc. was necessary ;-)
